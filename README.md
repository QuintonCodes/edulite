# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuintonCodes/edulite.git
   cd edulite
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Development Workflow

We use the following tools to ensure consistency:

- **ESLint** for code linting and enforcing coding standards
- **Jest** for running unit tests
- **Prettier** for automatic code formatting

# Prettier Setup (Required)

All developers **must install Prettier** to keep formatting consistent

1. Install the **Prettier extension** in your editor:
   - [VS Code Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

2. Enable **Format on Save** in your editor settings:

   ```json
   "editor.formatOnSave": true
   ```

3. Ensure Prettier is the default formatter:
   ```json
   "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
   ```
